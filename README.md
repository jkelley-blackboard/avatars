# avatars
scripts and stuff to help manage Learn avatars</br>
The plan is to capture helpful code for both creating batch .zip files AND for using REST API</br>
</br>
BATCH:</br>
The help page for batch is here: https://help.blackboard.com/Learn/Administrator/Hosting/User_Management/Avatars#:~:text=Upload%20system%20generated%20avatars</br>
Loaded Python and Powershell scripts to read a csv with key values and file names to create .zip packages to upload.<br>
</br>
REST:</br>
For REST API, it takes two steps - uploading the file and then PATCHing the user record with the file.<br>
